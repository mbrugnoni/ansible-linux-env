### What is this for?

I decided to automate the setup of my Linux desktop environment using Ansible. I threw together a few quick roles and will continue to add to them as I think of things that I want to carry over to all installs. Makes bringing up a new PC fairly quick and painless. This is in the early phases and I will try to refine as I go.
